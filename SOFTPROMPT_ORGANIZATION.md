## 🏆 Soft Prompt Model Highlights

### Why This Model Was Chosen:
1. **Best Performance**: 87%+ token alignment with CLIP embeddings
2. **Efficient**: Only ~150K trainable parameters (GeoCLIP frozen)
3. **Stable**: Consistent convergence across multiple runs
4. **Flexible**: Learnable dictionary adapts to geographic concepts
5. **Compatible**: Outputs [B,77,768] sequences for downstream use

### Key Innovation:
- **Soft Prompt Dictionary**: Learns K=64 "soft tokens" representing geographic concepts
- **Mixture Weights**: GPS coordinates → attention over dictionary → final sequence
- **Frozen Base**: Keeps GeoCLIP location encoder frozen for efficiency

### Usage:
```bash
# Train the model
cd experiments/training_variants/
python train_softprompt_model.py

# Run inference
python softprompt_inference.py
```
