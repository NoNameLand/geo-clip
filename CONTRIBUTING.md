- Research-focused code
- Less strict requirements than core package
- Should include brief documentation of purpose

## Coding Standards

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black default)

### Naming Conventions
- Functions and variables: `snake_case`
- Classes: `PascalCase`

- Include examples in docstrings for public APIs
- Update relevant documentation files

### Testing
- Add tests for new functionality
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Run tests before submitting: `pytest tests/`

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write clean, documented code
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   pytest tests/
   
   # Check code style
   black --check .
   flake8 .
   
   # Type checking (optional but recommended)
   mypy geoclip/
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
   ```

   Use conventional commit messages:
   - `feat:` for new features
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `docs:` for documentation changes
   - `test:` for test-related changes
   - `refactor:` for code refactoring

5. **Push and create pull request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Pull request checklist**
   - [ ] Tests pass
   - [ ] Code follows style guidelines
   - [ ] Documentation updated
   - [ ] Backward compatibility maintained (for core package)
